## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- MongoDB(Mongoose) installed

## Installation And Usage

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mahmud-bhuiyan/feature-request-board-server.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd feature-request-board-server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a .env file:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following information:

   ```
   MONGO_URL=your_mongo_connection_url
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_SECRET_KEY
   DB_NAME=your_DB_name
   PORT=3001
   ```

   Replace `your_mongo_connection_url` with your actual MongoDB connection URI and choose a suitable `PORT`.

4. **Start the server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   or
   nodemon start
   ```

   Access the application in a web browser at `http://localhost:3001`.

### Additional Tips:

- Verify that MongoDB is running and accessible with the provided URI.
- Make sure the MongoDB driver (Mongoose) is correctly installed.
- Check for any errors or warnings displayed in the console during server startup.
- Test API endpoints to ensure the backend functions as expected.

This setup process assumes you've already set up Node.js, MongoDB, and have access to the required credentials. Adjust the steps according to your specific environment and project structure.
